# Welcome to My GitHub Repository! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Galen (you can also call me Angel), and I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile. I have a passion for technology, sustainability, and connecting with civil associations and open-source projects. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in Java, Spring, web development, and artificial intelligence, constantly pushing myself to learn and grow.

## My Work
I'm currently working as a Mid Java Backend Engineer. Previously, I completed a Java backend internship in a consultancy company where I gained experience in Java, testing, and Spring. I developed projects such as a TicTacToe game with different difficulties, a blockchain simulator, and a simple search engine. Learning new technologies is my passion; I love experimenting with different operating systems, languages, and creating projects for fun.

## Collaboration Opportunities
I'm always on the lookout for exciting collaboration opportunities with like-minded individuals and organizations. If you're involved in civil associations, cooperatives, open-source projects, or volunteering initiatives, I'd love to hear from you and explore how we can work together to make a positive impact.
